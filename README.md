# Diabetes-prediction
# Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes at an early stage using machine learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. By leveraging these algorithms, we can provide accurate and reliable predictions to aid in early diagnosis and improved healthcare outcomes.

# Dataset
The dataset contains 769 cases with various health parameters used to determine if a patient is diabetic.

# Algorithms Used
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.
Achieved the highest accuracy of 86%.

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Constructs a hyperplane to segregate data into classes.
Achieved an accuracy of 84%.

3. Random Forest:
Constructs multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for classification.
Achieved an accuracy of 73%.

4. Decision Tree:
Recursively splits data into subsets based on the most significant feature.
Achieved an accuracy of 72%.
